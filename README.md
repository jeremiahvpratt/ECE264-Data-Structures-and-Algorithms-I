Data Structures and Algorithms I Project Work
 
 1. Implementation of stack and queue data structures, built on top of a from-scratch implementation of singly linked lists. Functionality demonstrated by accepting a file of commands and parsing them.
 
 2. Implementation of various sorting algorithms, with decision functionality implemented to choose the best sorting algorithm depending on the traits of the input data.
